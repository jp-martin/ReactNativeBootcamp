# ReactNativeBootcamp
A simple React Native app created as a portfolio project during the NuCamp Front End Web bootcamp

This app will be a proof of concept playground, to integrate React and React Native with a Drupal backend, that will also play nicely with Drupal's customizable page Layout Builder.
